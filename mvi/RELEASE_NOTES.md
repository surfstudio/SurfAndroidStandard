* ANDDEP-928 Remove Timber dependencies
* **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** ANDDEP-997 Renamed RequestEvent.type to RequestEvent.request.
Replaced RxMiddleware.asRequestEvent `Event` parameter with `EventFactory`.
* ANDDEP-968 `RequestEvent.kt`: added fields `isLoading`, `hasData`, `hasError`;
* ANDDEP-1046 Fixed output events observing mechanism in CompositionTransformer:
now event composition mechanism supports middlewares that can only produces output events.

* ANDDEP-1048 Fixing wrong docs links and docs structure
##### Mvi-impls
* ANDDEP-969 Added base classes: `BaseReactor` and `BaseReducer`;
* **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** ANDDEP-1049 Package for `BaseActivityResultDelegate`,`SupportOnActivityResultRoute` and `CrossFeatureSupportOnActivityResultRoute` is changed
from `ru.surfstudio.android.core.ui.event.result` to:  `ru.surfstudio.android.core.ui.navigation.event.result`
* ANDDEP-1048 Fixing wrong docs links and docs structure
* **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** ANDDEP-1124 Added `OpenScreenForResult` event that allows to start Activity for result explicitly. From this build using `OpenScreen` event doesn't start Activity for result
* **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** Removed ioHandleError() methods and RxBuilderHandleError dependency from BaseMiddleware. Use reducer to handleError instead.
* **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY** ScreenState added to BaseMiddlwareDependency. Do not forget to add it to dependencies in your ScreenModule.provideBaseMiddlewareDependency method.
* Added LifecycleFreezeMiddleware: it freezes certain observable until the screen doesn't moved in desired lifecycleStage. This middleware is connected to BaseMiddleware by default.
* Added PersistentCheckLifecycleMiddleware: it uses screenState to determine whether view was recreated, or entire screen was recreated after process death, and modifies Lifecycle functions by adding additional information to it. This middleware is connected to BaseMiddleware by default/
